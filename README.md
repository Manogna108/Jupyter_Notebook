# Jupyter_Notebook



This project takes three CSV files that contain information about actors,movies, movie studios, the years these movies are produced and the amount of money these actors made through these movies. With this given data, we organized them in ways that it would be easier to understand the data. We used differnt data visualizations such as scatter plots, line graphs,histograms and tables that represented a part of the original data. Once they were organized in such a way we analyzed the data providing insight on who made the most money or which year had the greatest production of movies. Overall, the notebook is very useful for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning. As it is flexible in most of the languages used in programming, it can be used with data from all computer languages without having to convert them to fit the notebook's requirements.
